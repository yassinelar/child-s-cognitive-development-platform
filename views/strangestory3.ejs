      <h2>Story 3</h2>
      <p>During the war, the Red army captures a member of the Blue army. They want him to tell them where his army’s tanks are; they know they are either by the sea or in the mountains. They know that the prisoner will not want to tell them, he will
        want to save his army and so he will certainly lie to them. The prisoner is very brave and very clever, he will not let them find his tanks. The tanks are really in the mountains. Now when the other side asks him where his tanks are, he says,
        ‘They are in the mountains.’ </p>
      <h3><em>Q3. Why did the prisoner say that?</em></h3>
